## Importance of programming standards
Programming standards refer to a set of guidelines and best practices that outline how code should be written, organized, and formatted. These standards are crucial for several reasons:

- Ensures that code is written in a consistent manner, making it easier for future developers to read, understand, and maintain extensions. When code follows a uniform style, other developers can quickly get up to speed, and easily navigate through the code without confusion.

- As projects grow, maintaining code can become a significant challenge. Adhering to programming standards helps in creating a clean and organized codebase, which in turn makes it easier to identify and fix bugs, add new features, and refactor existing code without introducing new issues.

- In a team environment, multiple developers often work on the same project. Programming standards facilitate smoother collaboration by ensuring everyone follows the same set of rules. This reduces the likelihood of conflicts and issues, thereby streamlining the development process.

- Programming standards make the code review process more efficient. Reviewers can focus on the logic and functionality of the code rather than spending time on stylistic issues. This leads to more thorough and productive code reviews, ultimately improving the overall code quality.

- Well-documented code is essential for long-term project success. Programming standards often include requirements for comments and documentation, ensuring that the code is self-explanatory and easy to understand. This is particularly important for future developers who may need to work on the code long after the original authors have moved on.

In conclusion, programming standards are an essential aspect of software development that contribute to the consistency, maintainability, and quality of the code. By adhering to these standards, developmeners can produce more reliable and efficient extensions ultimately leading to better outcomes for both developers and end-users.

## Extension Types
There are five types of extensions, below is a short description of each type.

### Trigger Extensions
Trigger extensions are used to hook or inject our own code in a specific method in M3 BE via extension points.

### Transaction Extensions
Transaction extensions are used to create custom M3 API transactions.

### Batch Extensions
Batch extensions are used for long-running jobs and can be executed/scheduled via *SHS010MI*.

### Utility Extensions
Utility extensions are used to create an extension program with collection of methods that can be called in other extensions.<br>
`utility.call(String utility, String method, Object... arguments)`

### Table Extensions
Table extensions, or Dynamic Tables, are custom database tables.<br>
It is possible to add columns, assign data types, unique keys, and indexes.

## Indentation and Formatting
Tab size: 2 spaces
Indent size: 2 spaces
Continuation indent: 4 spaces
Charset: utf-8  

XtendM3 uses Groovy programming and ending code lines with semicolons are optional.<br>
It is however recommended to stick to one standard within one extension, for easier readability. 

## Naming

### Extensions
Extension names should be a valid Java class name.
There are no restrictions on extension names, and they will run with no error when compiled.<br>
However, when creating extensions the naming conventions below should be followed for readability and maintenance.

__Module__  
`SMS`
`SLS`
`EQM`
`MNT`
`SRV`
`RTM`
`FIC`
`FIM`
`MAN`
`MAI`
`PDM`
`PJM`
`SCP`
`SCE`
`PUR`

__Program Type__  
`IW` Interactive  
`Fnc` Fnc Batch   
`Batch` Batch, Autostart Batch  
`MI` MI Batch  

__EXT ID__  
Specification/Extension ID  

__Description__  
- Description should be in UpperCamelCase  
- Try to keep extension description names simple and descriptive  
- Avoid acronyms of abbreviations unless the word is a common jargon such as CO, DO, MO  


#### Trigger Extensions
Format: `<Module>_<Type>_<EXT ID>_<Description>`  

Example:<br>

Type | Program | Extension name
------------ | -------------| -------------
Interactive| APS450| FIM_IW_1784_ValidateInvoice
Fnc Batch| APS450Fnc|FIM_Fnc_1784_ValidateInvoice
Batch| OOLINEPI| SLS_Batch_1784_ValidateCO
MI Batch| MMS100MI| SCE_MI_1784_ValidateDO

#### Utility Extensions
Format: `<Description>Utils`

Example: `DateUtils`

#### Transaction Extensions
- EXT9XXMI is reserved for standard extensions and should not be used
- When extending standard API, use same number suffix as standard program  
OIS100MI - EXT100MI  

- If there are same number suffix for standard API that needs to have extensions, use increment in number suffix  
MMS100MI - EXT101MI  

#### Table Extensions
`Format: EXT<XXX>`  
- When extending standard table or creating custom table, include the following standard fields  

Column Name | Description | Data Type | Length
------------ | -------------| ------------- | ------------- 
RGDT | Entry date | Decimal | 8
LMDT | Change date | String | 8
CHID | Changed by | String | 10
RGTM | Entry time | Decimal | 6 
CHNO | Change number | Decimal | 3

- For standard table extension, use EXT<abbr standard table name>  
OOHEAD - EXTOHD  
OOLINE - EXTOLN  

- For custom table extension, use EXT<XXX> same suffix as extension API  
Table - EXT001  
API - EXT001MI  

- Custom extension tables should contain homogenous data type. Generic tables are not allowed. I.e., if the table contain 'Items' as primary data, the table should not have 'Warehouses' as alternative primary data. 

- Custom extension field names should to denote what the column is for, rather than trying to describe the type/length or generic nature of them.

- Generic column names will not be accepted even though the actual columns might have been used correctly for a specific purpose and not in a generic way. The reason is to avoid misunderstandings, because generic tables are not going to be allowed.

#### Methods
- Method name should follow Java naming convention for methods 
- Names should be in lowerCamelCase, using no underscores and starting with a letter  
- Only alphanumeric characters should be used. Alphanumeric characters include the letters a-z, either upper case or lower case, and the numerals 0-9  
- Should be simple and descriptive: 
validateDate, 
validateType

#### Variables and Constants
- Variables and constants should be in lowerCamelCase, using no underscores and starting with a letter
- Only alphanumeric characters should be used. Alphanumeric characters include the letters a-z, either upper case or lower case, and the numerals 0-9
- should be simple and descriptive: inValidDate, outValidDateType
- Variables should be in lowerCamelCase and constants in CAPITAL_CONSTANTS

## Extension Structure
- Global variables and main method are declared at the beginning of the program as compared to M3 Java where these are declared at the end of the program:<br>
```groovy
  public class ExampleTransaction extends ExtendM3Transaction {
    private final DatabaseAPI database;
    private final LoggerAPI logger;
  
    private Integer globalInteger;
    private String globalString;
  
    public ExampleExtension(DatabaseAPI database, LoggerAPI logger) {
      this.database = database;
      this.logger = logger;
    }

    public void main() {
      globalInteger = 111;
      globalString = "example"
    }
  }
```

### Utility Extensions
- Utility extensions cannot contain global variables
- It is not possible to declare and create instance of API in utility extensions, instead API should be passed as parameters in utility methods:<br>
```groovy
  public class ExampleUtility extends ExtendM3Utility {

    public String exampleGet(String miParamter, MICallerAPI miCaller) {

      String returnValue;
      Map<String, String> parameters = ["EXPA": miParameter];

      Closure<?> response = { Map<String, String> response ->
        returnValue = response.get("EXPA");
      }

      miCaller.call("EXT000MI", "Get", parameters, response);
    }
  }
```

## Programming Practices
### Logging
- LoggerAPI is used for logging messages  
- It is encouraged to add logs in extensions to help in debugging and troubleshooting issues particularly on non-development environments (TRN, PRD) where there is restriction on modifying extensions  
- Use proper level of logging â€“ If extension is to be deployed in PRD, it should be limited to DEBUG level. Using INFO/WARNING/ERROR/TRACE on production environment can cause huge log size and impact MT Cloud environment  
- Avoid logging values of all returned fields in a database query  
- Logs can be accessed through Administration tool - Business Engine Jobs

<img src="../../../assets/attachments/programming-standard/businessEngineJobsLogging.PNG" width="950">

#### Log levels
- warning  
- error  
- info  
- trace  
- debug

### Database Access
- It is recommended to use standard APIs if transactions are available instead of direct database access on WRITE/UPDATE/DELETE where the program uses multiple tables to update. This could cause corrupt data if any on the logic, validation, or database update was missed or incorrectly updated  
- Make sure when using readLock that it is released at the end of the extension to avoid blocking another program access  
- When reading table with partial keys, verify that this will not return too many records. Include _nrOfRecords_ parameter when performing _readAll_ API calls
  - It is not allowed read more than 10,000 records per read. If there is a need to read more than 10,000 records, contact the review team with a good reasoning as to why it's needed
- When reading table, if possible, specify only the required column fields and avoid selectAllFields on querying tables particularly on tables which contains many fields  

### Loops
- In M3 Java old programming, there are codes such as _while(true)_ and performs multiple _break_ inside the loop. When using while loop, avoid using condition=_true_ and provide condition that will break the loop  

### Data Storage
#### In Memory
- SessionAPI is used to store information in key-value mapping that can be accessed between multiple extensions in the same session  
- Make sure to use unique identifier as key names to avoid conflicts with other extensions when adding content to the cache  
- Reassess when there is too much information that needs to be stored in a session. It may be more practical to add the information using XtendM3 tables instead  

#### In Customer Extension Table
- Customer extension table refers to CUGEX1, CUGEX2 and CUGEX3 tables and can be accessed through standard API, CUSEXTMI 
- Customer extension table should not be used for high volume data and high number of reads, updates, and deletes instead replace with XtendM3 tables  

#### In Dynamic Database
- Dynamic Database or XtendM3 table is the equivalent of MAK custom table  
- Table name uses prefix EXT and can have specific columns and logical keys
  ```groovy 
  void read() {
    DBAction query = database.table("EXTMIT")
      .index("00")
      .selection("EXITNO", "EXITDS")
      .build();
    DBContainer container = query.createContainer();
    container.set("EXCONO", 999);
    container.set("EXDIVI", "GGG");
    container.set("EXSTAT", "30");
    container.set("EXRESP", "KFHAKANSSON");
    if(query.read(container)) {
      String itemNumber = container.get("EXITNO");
      String itemDescription = container.get("EXITDS");
      mi.outData.put("RES1", itemNumber);
      mi.outData.put("RES2", itemDescription);
      mi.write();
    }
  }
  ```

#### In Text/XML/JSON File
- TextFilesAPI is the equivalent of MvxTextFile in M3 Java which can be used to read, write, or delete file  
  ```groovy
  public void readRecord(String folder, String record) {
    textFiles.open(folder);
    textFiles.read(record, "UTF-8", readFile);
  }
  
  Closure<?> readFile = { BufferedReader reader ->
    List<String> header = resolveFields(reader.readLine());
    while((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
      reader.println(line);
    }
    readResult = header.toString();
    mi.outData.put("RESU", readResult);
    mi.write();
  }  
  ```
  - More examples available here: [TextFilesAPI](https://infor-cloud.github.io/xtendm3/docs/documentation/api-specification/textfiles-api)  

### API Call
- M3 API can be run using IonAPI or MICallerAPI  
- It is preferred to use MICallerAPI which runs M3 API internally in the same layer as business engine instead of having another layer to execute M3 API  

#### ION API
- ION API provides secure access to M3 API and other registered application APIs through web services
- When using IonAPI in extension, the response should be parsed [XML/JSON Parsing](https://infor-cloud.github.io/xtendm3/docs/documentation/programming-standard/#xml--json-parsing)  
- If standard M3 API is not available and an existing interactive program can be used to perform M3 update,  ION API can be used to run IPS(Interactive Programming Services) which wraps the functionality of the program to perform M3 updates  

#### M3 API
- MICallerAPI is the equivalent of utility program cMICaller in M3 Java  

### XML / JSON Parsing
- XML response can be processed using Groovy classes [XmlParser and XmlSlurper](https://groovy-lang.org/processing-xml.html)  
- JSON response can be processed using Groovy class [JsonSlurper](https://groovy-lang.org/json.html)  

### Date and Time
- Use classes [LocalDate](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/time/LocalDate.html), [LocalTime](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/time/LocalTime.html), [LocalDateTime](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/time/LocalDateTime.html) if required to retrieve current date or manipulate date or time  
`int entryDate = LocalDate.now().format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyyMMdd")).toInteger()`  
`int entryTime = LocalDateTime.now().format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("HHmmss")).toInteger()`

### Variable Types
- It is not allowed to use *__def__* statements in XtendM3, the type should be known
  - If the type is unknown, use *__Object__*
 
## Testing
Extension approval requires submission of approved Unit test and Functional test documents    

### Local
- Extensions can be locally tested using [XtendM3 SDK](https://github.com/infor-cloud/xtendm3-sdk-java) which provides the interfaces for the internal APIs available to XtendM3 Extensions. This SDK can be used to build, test and debug Extensions locally without needing to have any M3 environment up and running  
- A sample repository [ACME Corp. XtendM3 Extensions](https://github.com/infor-cloud/acme-corp-extensions) is provided to get you started on setting up project directories for the source codes, test scripts and XtendM3 SDK  

### Live
- In the case that the program is a Trigger type extension, it automatically runs and the changes to the program are seen by the users as long as the extension is activated. During unit testing, it is recommended that the extension should execute only for specific users until it is verified to be working in order to avoid interrupting other users running the same program.<br>
Provided is an example of validating extension to run for specific user(s):
  ```groovy
  private boolean isEnabled() {
    if (program.getUser()  != "USERNAME") {
      return false
    }
    return true
    }
  ```

- API or Transaction extensions can be tested via Metadata Publisher.

- Similarly to Transactions, Batch extensions can be tested via Metadata Publisher and SHS010MI.

## Version Controlling
More details are provided at [Version Controlling](https://infor-cloud.github.io/xtendm3/docs/documentation/version-controlling/).

### Framework
Git version control system should be used.  

### Structure
Refer to the example of an [XtendM3 Extension Repository](https://github.com/infor-cloud/acme-corp-extensions) to version control extensions. 

### Hosting
Any Git provider that the customer prefers GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and etc.  

### Code Documentation
- Extension JavaDoc on top of extension classes is required
- Extension Methods JavaDoc on top of methods (except for main) is recommended
  - Example:

## Review Comments
Common comments brought up during review.

* **Field Validation**<br>
There should always be validation present for standard M3 fields and date fields.

* **Line endings**<br>
In an extension there should be consistent use of semicolons, either no semicolons or semicolons on all line endings.

* **Imports**<br>
Make sure no unused imports are present.

* **Indentation**<br>
For readability, indentation should be consistent throughout the code.<br>
See 'Indentation and Formatting' section above.

* **Method Comments**<br>
Every method(except main) in an extension should have a comment describing the funtionality, it is recommended to comment in JavaDoc style(see above section).

* **Program Header**<br>
Every extension requires a program header which include the name, type, script author, date, description and revision history(see above section). Remember to update the revision history when updating an existing extension.

* **Table Description**<br>
Every Dynamic Table should incldude a descritpion.

* **Variable and Method naming**<br>
Names of variables and methods should be in **lowerCamelCase**.
